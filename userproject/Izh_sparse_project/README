4: Pulse-coupled Izhikevich network

Can be used as: 
tools/generate_run_1comp generate_izhikevich_network_bm [CPU/GPU] [nNeurons] [nConn] [gscale] [outdir] [model name] [debug OFF/ON] [use previous connectivity OFF/ON]


This example creates a pulse-coupled network with 80% excitatory 20% inhibitory connections, each connecting to nConn neurons with sparse connectivity.

To use an example, navigate to the "userproject/Izh_sparse_project" directory and type
"../../tools/generate_izhikevich_network_run 1 10000 1000 1 outdir Izh_sparse 0 0"
