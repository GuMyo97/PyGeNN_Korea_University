synaptic plasticity

load optimisation?

pthreads

mpi

Fix Poisson neuron firing rates (currently depend on the time step & arbitrary scale)

Find a more elegant way to set synapse grid sizes for sparse and mixed sparse/dense connectivities (consider defining grid size values as variables)

Consider the option to use zero-copy memory for g arrays in bigger networks to save from the global memory
