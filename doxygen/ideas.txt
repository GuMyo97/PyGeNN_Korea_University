/*! \page Ideas TODO list 
\section Ideas for GeNN development:

- add error checking in addNeuronPopulations:
  - maximum number of neuron populations? Or estimating resources beyound what is done at code generation stage?
  - check for missing minimal 1 neuron population?
  - check for name equality of neuron populations and throw error message?

- add error checking for addSynapsePopulations:
  - maximal number / resource checking?
  - minimal number check - revisit, should 0 be allowed?
  - check whether neuron populations exist. 
  - check for unique name

- There is a global flag int optimiseBlockSize= 1; this should be
  passed through to users or replaced by some approriate logic. This
  goes together with improving block size optimisation in my mind. (global.h)

- Is the macro for the number of predefined neuron types (NTYPENO in
  modelSpec.h) really necessary?

- do something meaningful for sparse connectivity(!)

- #define SPK_THRESH 0.0f (in modelSpec.h) is this really the way to do it? User
   control? global settings somewhere?

- in modelSpec.cc: void NNmodel::initDerivedNeuronPara(unsigned int i)
  - error checking for if it is called twice OR allowing multiple
  - calls but setting DNP values by index instead of simply appending.

- GeNN currently only supports parameter-homogeneous populations of
  neurons. An interesting extension could be individual parameters
  (this is a major change though, as parameters would need to become
  variables in the CUDA angle of things (and stored in device
  memory?).

- Omissions in code documentation: ModelSpec.cc (does it need more details?)
