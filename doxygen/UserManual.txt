\section sIntro Introduction
GeNN is a software library for facilitating the simulation of neuronal
network models on NVIDIA CUDA enable GPU hardware. It was designed
with computational neuroscience models in mind rather than artificial
neural networks. The main philosophy of GeNN is two-fold:
- GeNN relies heavily on code generation to make it very flexible and
allow adjusting simulation code to the model of interest and the GPU
hardware that is detected at compile time.
- GeNN is lightweight in that it provides code for running models of
neuronal networks on GPU hardware but it leaves it to the user to
write a final simulation engine. It so allows maximal flexibility to
the user who can use any of the provided code but can fully choose,
inspect, extend or otherwise modify the generated code. She can also
introduce her own optimisations and in particular control the data
flow from and to the GPU in any desired granularity.

This User guide gives an overview how to use GeNN for a novice user and
tries to lead the user to more expert use later on. With this we jump
right in.
 
\section sect1 Defining a model
A model is defined by the user by providing the function 
\code{.cc}
void modelDefinition(NNmodel &model) 
\endcode
in this function the following tasks must be completed:
- The name of the model must be defined:
\code{.cc}
model.setName("MyModel");
\endcode

- neuron populations (at least one) must be added (see \ref subsect11). The
  user may add as many neuron population as she wishes. If resources
  run out, there will not be a warning but GeNN will fail. All
  populations should have a unique name.

- synapse populations (at least one) must be added (see \ref subsect12). Again,
  the number of synaptic connection populationsis unlimited other than
  by resources.

\subsection subsect11 Defining neuron populations

Neuron populations are added using the function
\code{.cc}
model.addNeuronPopulation("PN", _NAL, POISSONNEURON, myPOI_p, myPOI_ini);
\endcode
where the arguments are:
\arg \c const \c char* name: Name of the neuron population
\arg \c int n: number of neurons in the population
\arg \c int TYPE: Type of the neurons, refers to either a standard type (see below) or user-defined type
\arg \c float *para: Parameters of this neuron type
\arg \c float *ini: Initial values of this neuron type 

The user may add as many neuron populations as the model necessitates. They should all have unique names.

\subsection subsect12 Defining synapse populations

Synapse populations are added with the command
\code{.cc}
model.addSynapsePopulation("PNKC", NSYNAPSE, DENSE, INDIVIDUALG, "PN",
"KC", myPNKC_p);
\endcode
where the arguments are
\arg \c const \c char* name: The name of the synapse population, here
"PNKC"
\arg \c int \c sType: The type of synapse to be added, here the
predefined type "NSYNAPSE". See below for the available predefined
synapse types.
\arg \c int \c sConn: The type of synaptic connectivity, here the
predefined constant "DENSE"; the options currently are "ALLTOALL",
"DENSE", "SPARSE"
\arg \c int \c gType: The way how the synaptic conductivity g will be
defined, here the predefined constant "INDIVIDUALG"; options are
"INDIVIDUALG", "GLOBALG", "INDIVIDUALID". For their meaning, see \ref
subsect33 below.
\arg \c char* \c preName: Name of the (existing!) per-synaptic neuron
population, here "PN".
\arg \c char* \c postName: Name of the (existing!) post-synaptic neuron
population, here "KC".
\arg \c float* \c sParam: A C-type array of floats that contains
parameter values (common to all synapses of the population) which will
be used for the defined synapses. The array must contain the right
number of parameters in the right order for the chosen synapse
type. If too few, segmentation faults will occur, if too many, excess
will be ignored. 

Warnings: 1. If the synapse conductance definition type is "GLOBALG" the
global value of the synapse conductances must be set with
setSynapseG().


\section sect2 Predefined neuron types
There is a number of predefined models which can be chosen in the \c
addNeuronGroup function by their unique cardinal number, starting from
0. For convenience, C constants with readable names are predefined:
- 0: \ref sect21 "MAPNEURON" 
- 1: \ref sect22 "POISSONNEURON"
- 2: \ref sect23 "TRAUBMILES"
- 3: \ref sect24 "IZHIKEVICH"

\subsection sect21 Map Neurons
The MAPNEURON type is a map based neuron model as defined in \cite
Rulkov2002 .

It has 2 variables:
- 0: V - the membrane potential
- 1: preV - the membrane potential at the previous time step

and it has 4 parameters:
- 0: Vspike - the membrane potential at the top of the spike
- 1: alpha - determines the shape of the iteration function
- 2: y - also determines the iteration function
- 3: beta - roughly regulates the scale of the input into the neuron


\section sect3 Predefined synapse models
\subsection subsect31 Models
\subsection subsect32 Connectivity types
\subsection subsect33 Conductance definition methods
The available options work as follows:
- INDIVIDUALG: When this option is chosen in the \c
addSynapsePopulation command, GeNN reserves an array of size n_pre x
n_post float for individual conductance values for each combination of
pre and postsynaptic neuron. The actual values of teh conductances are
passed at runtime from the user side code, using the \c copyGToDevice
function.

- GLOBALG: When this option is chosen, the \c addSynapsePopulation
  command must be followed within the \c modelDefinition function by a
  call to \c setSynapseG for this synapse population. This option can
  only be sensibly combined with connectivity type ALLTOALL. 

- INDIVIDUALID: When this option is chosen, GeNN expects to use the
same maximal conductance for all existing synaptic connections but
which synapses exist will be defined at runtime from the user side
code.

\section sect4 Defining your own neuron model 

In order to define a new neuron model for use in a GeNN application,
it is necessary to populate an object of class \c neuronModel and
append it to the global vector \c nModels. The \c neuronModel class
has several data members that make up the full description of the
neuron model:

- \c simCode of type \c string: This needs to be assigned a C++ string
  that contains the code for executing the integration of the model
  for one time step. Within this code string, variables need to be
  referred to by $(NAME), where NAME is the name of the variable as
  defined in the vector varNames. The code may refer to the predefined
  primitives "DT" for the
  time step size and "Isyn" for the total incoming synaptic current.

- \c varNames of type \c vector<string>: This vector needs to be
  filled with the names of variables that make up the neuron
  state. The variables defined here as "NAME" can then be used in the
  syntax $(NAME) in the code string.

- \c varTypes of type \c vector<string>: This vector needs to be
  filled with the variable type (e.g. "float", "double", etc) for the
  variables defined in \c varNames. Types and variables are matched to
  each other by position in the respective vectors.

- \c pNames of type \c vector<string>: This vector will contain the names
 of parameters relevant to the model. If defined as "NAME" here, they
 can then be referenced as "$(NAME)" in the code string. The length of
 this vector determines the expected number of parameters in the
 initialisation of the neuron model. Parameters are currently assumed
 to be always of type float.

- \c dpNames of type \c vector<string>: Names of dependant
  parameters. This is a mechanism for enhanced efficiency for running
  neuron models. If parameters with model-side meaning, such as time
  constants or conductances always appear in a certain combination in
  the model, then it is more efficient to pre-compute the combination
  and define it as a dependent parameter. This vector contains the
  names of such dependent parameters.

- \c tmpVarNames of type \c vector<string>: This vector can be used to
  request additional variables that are not part of the state of the
  neuron but used only as temporary storage during evaluation of the
  integration time step. 

- \c tmpVarTypes of type \c vector<string>: This vector will contain
  the variable types of the temporary variables.

Once the completed \c neuronModel object is appended to the \c nModels
vector it can be used in network descriptions by referring to its
cardinal number in the nModels vector. I.e., if the model is added as
the 4th entry, it would be model "3" (counting starts at 0 in usual C
convention). The information of the cardinal number of a new model can
be obtained by referring to \c nModels.size() right before appending
the new model. 

For dependent parameters in a user-defined model, it is the user's
responsibility to intitialize the derived parameters from the relevant
entries of the global \c neuronPara vector entries, to store them in a
vector and append this vector to the global vector \c dnp. This needs
to be done right after the call to addNeuronPopulation that involves
the neuron model in questions. For an
example of what needs to be done, refer to the member function \c
initDerivedNeuronPara() of class \c NNmodel which does this for Rulkov map neurons.

\section sect5 Explicit inputs to neurons 
User can decide whether a neuron group receives external input current or not 
in addition to the synaptic input that it receives from the network.
External input to a neuron group is activated by calling 
\c activateDirectInput function. It receives two arguments: The first argument is 
the name of the neuron group to receive input current. The second parameter defines 
the type of input. Current options are:

- 0: NOINP: Neuron group receives no input. This is the value by default
 when the explicit input is not activated.

- 1: CONSTINP: All the neurons receive a constant input value. This value may also be
defined as a variable.

- 2: MATINP: Input is read from a file containing the input matrix.

- 3: INPRULE: Input is defined as a rule. It differs from CONSTINP by the way that the
input is injected: CONSTINP creates a value which is modified in real time, hence complex 
instructions are limited. INPRULE creates an input array which will be copied into 
the device memory.
